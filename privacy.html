                <h1>Data Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    Your privacy is important to us at Ivy Health Care (IHC), and we take it very seriously. If a client
                    or employee has designated you as their close relative or emergency contact, we may have your
                    personal information even though you may not be an IHC employee or customer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>To what extent is your information protected, and by whom?</h1>
                <p>
                    If we utilise paper records, we save this information in a closed file cabinet within a lockable
                    room. If we use a password-protected paperless filing system on a secure server, we store this
                    information safely. Access is only possible for those who need it, and only under dire
                    circumstances. We shall determine what an emergency is based on a case-by-case analysis. Our
                    internal policies tightly regulate how we handle your personal data. The IHC will never send your
                    information to nations outside of the European Economic Area.
                </p>

                <h1>Who are we and why is it necessary for us to handle your personal data?</h1>
                <p>
                    Regarding the personal data you provide, the IHC serves as the data controller. Any information that
                    is about you or has sufficient details to allow us to identify you is considered personal
                    information. Processing emergency contact and next-of-kin information while a person is employed and
                    during the term of a customer’s care package is in the legitimate interest of the IHC. The IHC can
                    keep accurate and current employment records and contact information—specifically, who to call in an
                    emergency—by processing this information. Our legal justification for keeping your information is
                    our legitimate interest. Go to the ICO website to learn more about what constitutes a genuine
                    interest.
                </p>

                <h1>What kinds of data does the IHC gather?</h1>
                <p>
                    The only people who will let the IHC gather and use this data are staff members or clients who have
                    designated you as their next of kin or emergency contact. Only those workers or clients who have
                    designated you as their emergency contact and/or next of kin will have their information gathered by
                    the IHC. Your contact number, name, and relationship to the person will be included in this
                    information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of this Data Privacy Policy, service-user health data is any personally
                    identifiable information that can be credibly linked to a client and that represents the client’s
                    current, historical, or prospective mental or physical status.
                </p>
                <ul>

                        derived or inferred from non-health information;</li>
                    <li>j) data that identifies an individual seeking health care service;</li>
                    <li>k) geographical data that would logically suggest an effort by a customer to obtain or receive
                        medical supplies or services;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Client health data does not include personal information used for publicly available or
                    peer-reviewed
                    scientific, historical, or statistical research that conforms with all other applicable ethical and
